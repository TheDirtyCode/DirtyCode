# DirtyCode

Our mission is fighting for the freedom of the developers all over the world from the enemies who're working on the clean
code and inventing new rules and restrictions for our code every day. The freedom of code and developers is our target  ✌️

## Dirty Code Pros  👍
- [ ] No strict rules, no architecture, no design patterns, no planning, no refactoring, no discussions.
  You're totally free!
  Just go ahead and write what you have in your mind 😀
- [ ] More time writing, maintaining, and fixing the code. Companies will need more developers and will pay more.
This means more opportunities and more money for us  💲💲 👋👋
- [ ] The code will be hard to understand and this will make us smart people 😀

## Dirty Code Cons  👎
No one can break the dirty code strength and come up with any cons. Just pros forever 💪 👏

## The Truth
Don't believe us, please don't believe us  🤣🤣🙏🙏
Just do the opposite of what we say here and everything will be great. 🤨🤨
